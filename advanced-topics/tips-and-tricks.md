# Tips & Tricks (WIP)

#### Site Search all Dortania Guides

* For example in Google: `site:dortania.github.io XhciPortLimit`
* [site:dortania.github.io XhciPortLimit - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adortania.github.io+XhciPortLimit)

#### Search before Upgrading macOS

* [macOS / OS X Updates | tonymacx86.com](https://www.tonymacx86.com/forums/macos-os-x-updates.32/)
* [New Releases and Updates | InsanelyMac](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/157-new-releases-and-updates/)

#### More ways to download macOS

* [How to download macOS from Apple's official download locations (3 methods) : hackintosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/efjy5g/how\_to\_download\_macos\_from\_apples\_official/)
* [MacRecoveryX](https://github.com/AngeloAvv/MacRecoveryX)

#### Add OpenCore version to Config.plist

* Add the OpenCore version inside Config.plist as a comment
* This will facilitate keeping track of different versions of EFIs, especially since the OpenCore version cannot be seen inside a backed up EFI folder
* It should also help during upgrades when looking for differences between the versions
* Disadvantage is that the version number cannot be automatically updated

* Hackintosh Tools Evaluation: expand descriptions on [Checklist Tools](../step-by-step/hackintosh-checklist/checklist-tools.md)
* Guide for Upgrading macOS (minor point upgrades and major version upgrades): expand [Upgrade OpenCore](../step-by-step/oc-auxiliary-tools-upgrade.md)
* Clone USB drive / SSD drive together with EFI (CCC & Script or Super Duper & Script)
* Automated Linux hardware analysis tool for Hackintosh compatibility checking
* Semi-Automated testing script of a finished/upgraded hackintosh
* Anonymous CC Credit Card for adding a payment method to AppleID (?!)
* Windows or Linux version of the Beginners Guide
* Beginners should avoid...
* Virtualization notes. Proxmox etc.
